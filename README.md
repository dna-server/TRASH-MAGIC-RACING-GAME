# TRASH-MAGIC-RACING-GAME
a default racing game engine


which runs on a portable handheld gaming device
the TRASH MAGIC RACING GAME shall be hardwired into the circuitry simply because that is the only thing that this device is ever intended to do
- as usual, the device will still be disassemblable and upcyclable; the buttons and batteries and drives and etc. are easily removable and switchable without damage and instructions are included on how to perform this

the generic default TRASH MAGIC RACING GAME that is wired onto the device features colored spheres racing around a blocky, unstylized circuit. this game is always available for play on the device.
  - but the point is that some type of card, chip, circuit, hardmod, cartridge, etc. is plugged jacked inserted into the device to customize the game.

customizations of the TRASH MAGIC RACING GAME should be as varying as we can allow. game mechanics and skins should be swappable, so that a random trash witch might write code to upcycle the generic TRASH MAGIC RACING GAME into a car racing game like need 4 speed, or a cartoon racing game like the muppet's racing game, or even frodo and sauron racing gokarts around mount doom. levels, features, aesthetics, loading screens, menu options, button presses, sfx, music, etc. should all be customizable. creative emergent properties of unexpected combinations of mildly improbably outcomes should allow for exciting unprecendented possibilities which can only be discovered when lots of magicians spend a lot of time creating a bunch of crazy new stuff for fun to see what works and improving the best stuff while removing the things that are getting in the way. thus, everything copies, edits, and deletes. self-replication as a process lends itself to the creation of emergent properties.

this game is not intended for freeworld exploration. it is not intended as a character-based game, a fps, or an rpg. it is solely intended for racing user-players around a circuit-track.

the handheld portable device is a palmbox device. the box should be simple. its should be easy to hold and see, extremely easy, comfortable, and even fun to press the buttons, easy to change volume / mute or brightness, easy to pause and turn on and off, not able to be accidentally powered on when it's in your pocket or something, operate on battery power, contain a headphone jack, be durable.

it must obviously be open-source, free to build, easy to modify / upcycle, and contain its own replication instructions.
